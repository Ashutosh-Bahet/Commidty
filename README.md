# BERT-based Model Training and Evaluation

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a BERT-based model for NLP tasks, focusing on fine-tuning and evaluating performance using TensorFlow and PyTorch. It covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and tokenization using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on a specific NLP dataset.
- Optimization techniques such as gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and dynamic loss tracking.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and confusion matrix.

## Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install transformers torch tensorflow datasets scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## File Structure
- `BERT.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
- `data/`: Directory for dataset storage (if applicable).
- `models/`: Directory for saving fine-tuned models.
- `outputs/`: Directory for storing evaluation results.

## How to Use
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Tokenize text inputs using a pre-trained BERT tokenizer.
3. Fine-tune the BERT model on the dataset.
4. Evaluate performance using various metrics.
5. Save and deploy the trained model for inference.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 84.4% and an MCC of 0.70 on test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in sentiment analysis.
